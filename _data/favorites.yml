    text: 'I spent a good chunk of time in 2018 trying to write a horror novel. Imposter
      syndrome and writer''s block worked in concert together to prevent anything
      substantial from being produced and the story lives in my head to this day,
      taunting me. One useful culprit for keeping this story from disappearing entirely
      from my mind is Dance With the Dead''s _Loved to Death_. It''s campy horror
      sound hints at the feel I wanted to capture in my writing. Riding a line between
      techno/dance and power metal, this California-based duo really gave me something
      to feed off of in my creative moments, much in the same way _The Grid_ by Mega
      Drive did in the previous year. The tense and victorious rhthyms kept me focused,
      and the songs seem to demand a story all by themselves. Perhaps one day I''ll
      get that story written.

      to would have so much black metal in it. I loved _Sunbather_ when it came out
      in 2013 but never really had a moment to myself where the thought occured that
      "Hey, I like this band." I let _New Bermuda_ come and go without any attention,
      but for some reason found myself chained to _Ordinary Corrupt Human Love_ throughout
      the summer. I think it will always remind me of the long walks along the streets
      of Astoria, Queens that I took while listening to this album. It''s hopeful
      and beautiful lyrics are hard to decipher through Clarke''s static screams,
      but the heart of this record is found in every element of its makeup. This record,
      more than any of the others I listened to this year, feels like a piece of art.

      on a new blink-182 album, this record is Direct Hit!''s most dynamic and mature
      record yet. Frequently wrestling with themes of death and the meaning of life,
      this existentialism-as-concept-album shows a band reaching for something higher
      than another pop punk album with a hard candy shell. Revelling in their nihilist
      refutations of our traditional conceptions of heaven and hell, Direct Hit! asks
      us to enjoy what we can in this terrible world before we inevitably shuffle
      off this mortal coil, and that''s cool with me.

      is very pretty and very sad. I don''t listen to a lot to EDM, but _''Til the
      End_ caught my attention for it''s ability to constantly pull my attention back
      with its narrative. Woven between instrumentals, the break-up of a relationship
      unfolds via MitiS''s guest singers while the tracks themselves dance around
      the subject at hand. The desperate bargaining of _By My Side_ describes that
      terror of impending heartbreak, while it is harshly rebutted in _For Miles &
      Miles_ telling the listener to "Don''t think just walk away and forget me."
      _Embers_ ends the story with romanticized denial finally giving way to acceptance,
      and the record leaves us with a victorious few minutes to contemplate where
      we go now in _Dreams_.

      to his first Vandals record. I don''t speak Japanese and haven''t looked up
      any translations, so I can''t comment on the lyrics but the harmonizing and
      break-neck cadence is exactly what I need to feel like trying to re-master doing
      kickflips off the curb.

    favorite_track: She's a Myth
    text: "After a flurry of singles and EPs over two years, Danish band Communions
      finally released their first full-length record _Blue_. The record carries itself
      along the same well-trodden path of many recent post-punk bands like **The Strokes**,
      **Interpol**, and **The Vaccines**, which themselves are step-children of many
      forebears. While **Communions** aren't necessarily breaking new ground with
      _Blue_, it shouldn't incumbent upon every act to do so. Instead I find myself
      welcoming a new chapter to the genre. Sometimes we all want something we recognize.
      In that regard, _Blue_ is a finely tuned homage. \n\nSinger Martin Rehof's high-pitched
      wail pairs with the instrumentation on this record perfectly, with the intro-free
      record throwing the listener immediately into the thick of it. 40 seconds in
      and you are already in an ear-worm chorus that can only be removed with multiple
      listens.\n\nKnowing that they aren't playing anything we haven't heard before,
      **Communions** puts a lot of love into this record, where even the more boring
      tracks like _Midnight Child_ or _Got to Be Free_ are less apparent than hits
      like _She's a Myth_."

      of mine is basically a foregone conclusion. The band is so prolific that often
      the decision is not whether or not their latest record belongs in this year''s
      list, it''s which one belongs there. But the idea of these guys putting together
      a narrative-driven concept album based on fantastic stories of human-animal
      hybrids, lightning battles, and a universe murdered by vomit, I didn''t even
      need to hear the record to know it was one of my favorites. The chaotic rhythms
      and breakneck tempos are to be expected from **King Gizz**, but what sets this
      record apart from their other albums is the spoken-word narrators, something
      they haven''t done since _Eyes Like the Sky_

    text: "Liz Harris' often overlooked 2007 album _Cover the Windows and the Walls_
      is a fantastic work of dreamy ambient reverb. Like every wave of sound in these
      collected seven tracks, the records sound bubbles up from a restful ocean that
      keeps you afloat for about 40 minutes before drifting away once again. \n\nGrouper's
      first couple of albums came to my attention on through a small ambient music
      file-sharing blog that I stumbled on some sleepy evening in my college dorm
      room. The year before, I moved from a suburban sprawl in central Florida to
      Jersey City, NJ, every sight was unlike anything I'd grown up around. My daily
      life had become a montage of newness that craved a soundtrack. Looking over
      the records that I listened to the most that year, including the ones listed
      next to this record, I listened to a lot of ambient. \n\nHarris' vocals are
      present but lost in the fog of sound that envelops this entire album. The only
      percussion is the ringing echo of the heavily blurred guitar strings being plucked.
      What you're left with is a beautiful and mysterious soundscape that doesn't
      lend itself to singles, but rather must be taken as a whole work."

    text: 'When **Pedro the Lion** announced their breakup, I was pretty sad. I mean,
      I had always understood **PTL** to be David Bazan''s musical vehicle and any
      other musician accompanying him was merely a temporary passenger, so it was
      confusing that it even _could_ breakup. I eventually understood that Bazan had
      simply tired of the moniker and wished to be honest about what this really was.
      Explaining his decision in his first solo release, Bazan sings "I still run
      the show / Don''t you forget it / So I had to let some go / Don''t think I don''t
      regret it / Because I do and I don''t / Think I''m better off alone" and makes
      it pretty clear. Bazan had shed his faith and was now shedding any pretense
      of even being in a band and this would allow him to go beyond what he had created
      **Pedro the Lion** for.

    text: "Brandtson's original midwest emo sound is virtually erased in this album.
      The evolution that began in their previous album, _Send Us a Signal_, is further
      fleshed out in this release. You would never suspect this was the same group
      of kids that put out _Dial In Sounds_ just a few years before. Heavy synth dance
      beats compete with and compliment Jolley's drumming and vocals on tracks like
      _Nobody Dances Anymore, Here We Go,_ and _The Secret_. Only in a couple places
      can you hear traces of their original emo sound. \n\nIt's always risky when
      a band completely changes their sound, but in this case I really loved how Brandtson's
      sound was maturing with their last two albums and the EP _Death & Taxes_. Ultimately,
      the band broke up after recording a follow-up album that was never released,
      so this is all we'll ever get to see from them. \n\n_Hello Control_ is a hook-heavy
      and danceable album that is a lot of fun and delivers on every track. Each song
      has something to add to the album and I still keep returning to it years later."

    favorite_track: Foregone Conclusions
    text: |-
      This album was Bazan's farewell to the **Pedro The Lion** project. After years of rotating bandmates and a falling out with longtime collaborator **T.W. Walsh**, Bazan decided it was time to hangup the Lion. I remember feverishly reading through _Pitchfork Media_ articles on a community college classroom computer in Florida at the time. Bazan's music had become some of the most inspirational and heartfelt content I had ever heard up to that point and it was sad to think that he was ending something that had become so important to me.

      The record itself has continued to gain favor with me even as the years pass. The tone of the album is nowhere close to the gnashing distorted guitars of _Control_; but neither is it a return to the soft, muted tones of his first two albums _Winners_, or _Friends_. The jangling guitars remind me more of the garage rock revival that was going on at the time. Here too, we can hear Bazan's vocal prowess evolve on the album's opening track _Bands With Managers_, where Bazan springs into a falsetto over the repeated chorus.

      My favorite track, _Foregone Conclusions_, is a sarcastic response to his proselytizing peers that shows a Bazan--whose nuanced Christianity was already nearing its breaking point--flirting with heresy.

      The album is a collection of dark stories that list a number of weaknesses that Bazan was struggling with; whether they be his bandmates, his faith, drinking, or love.

    favorite_track: Hannibal, MO
    text: |-
      Al James' breathy whisper conveys such an aching pain in these songs, that a full listen to this album is guaranteed to bring me to tears. In the days that I was writing music for various bands, I longed to be able to convey an honest feeling such as James does here.

      Throwing one's life away for a momentary pleasure as described in _Traded for Fire_ carries so much of the Christian guilt I had been raised with that I feel my hands shake when those first warbling piano keys strike, like an alarm bringing me out of a deep sleep.

      So jealous of James' writing was I that I once lied to an old girlfriend that I had written _Hannibal, MO_ when she heard me sing it for her on a dark summer night during a power outage in Manhattan. His persistent belief that he is not worthy of redemption is so powerful here and his soft resignation to it strikes me right in my heart. A man sits in prison after the unfortunate death of his lover announces that "Her father says he'll shoot me down, if I don't do it myself."

    text: 'Bazan''s _Control_ is one of the most influential and powerful records
      I''ve ever listened to. The record''s depiction of relationships and their entropic
      conclusions was a relatable subject during my teens as the child of bitterly
      divorced parents. Listening to an (at the time) Christian artist that was willing
      to talk about these kinds of subjects was therapeutic. I could relate to a lot
      of his frustrations of being a believer disillusioned with modern American Christianity
      and wondering what that meant (A subject further explored in his subsequent
      albums and career). The crunching mid-tempo droning rock is a departure for
      **Pedro the Lion** that allowed the instrumentation of his songs reflect a lot
      of the violence told in these songs. The brutal honesty of tragic vanity is
      hammered home in each track as the loose narrative of a failed businessman who
      destroys his marriage and family with his infidelity, a path that ultimately
      leads him to finally be killed by his wife during an argument. I was lucky enough
      to watch a reunited **Pedro** play the _Control_ album in its entirety live
      in 2012 and loved watching these songs performed after spending so many evenings
      listening to this record.

      by the ones I''ve loved" was exactly the record I needed at that time which,
      along with **Hot Rod Circuit''s** _Sorry About Tomorrow_, allowed me to feel
      and preserve that experience in a way that I can nostalgically revisit with
      these songs.

    text: "I'm of two minds when I listen to this record. It's such a pretty album.
      It's such a well produced and curated selection of late-nineties indie rock.
      But it's hardly a **Sunny Day Real Estate** album. \n\nWhen I listen to this
      album, I'm transported back in time to those awkward teenage years where everything
      seemed so damned important. The clothes you wore, the people you were seen with,
      the music you listened to--these were the currency we traded in and I was no
      different from my peers. Emo music was huge and a second generation of bands
      were taking up where bands from the 80s and the early 90s had left off. I was
      all over it. Anything that could have that title applied to it became fodder
      for my ears.\n\nI believe I owe Napster a lot of credit for the music nerd I
      grew into, and it was there that I learned about **Sunny Day Real Estate**.
      Discovering a band that helped define the genre and shape its sound made me
      feel like I had some sort of secret knowledge that others didn't. Hearing they
      were reunited once again and coming out with another album was amazing news.\n\nMy
      dad bought me this record. I remember sitting in my brother's bedroom in Florida
      and eagerly listening to the opening crescendo of _Killed By An Angel_. But
      again, this is hardly an **SDRE** album. Enigk's lyrics are actually discernible
      for once. One can immediately hear a lot of prog rock influences on this record,
      and I personally hear a lot of **Kansas**.\n\nYears later, it's not my favorite
      **SDRE** album, but it still has songs to look forward to--like _Disappear_
      with it's driving beat and whining guitars--that remind me of the band I know
      they once were."
