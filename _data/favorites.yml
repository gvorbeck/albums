      As a concept band, Masked Intruder songs will always be about crime perpetrated in the name of unrequited love. It's problematic if you think too hard on the subject matter, but it seems clear from their bubble-gum pop punk songs that they'd prefer if you thought of them as a group of lovable rascals that just don't know any better. Their third album, appropriately titled _III_ is their best effort yet, with every song refusing to kick anything less than my whole ass. From taunting police with a lack of evidence, inviting your lover to become your literal partner in crime, to regretfully bidding farewell as singer Blue starts another bid in prison. I spent a good deal of 2019 in rehearsal spaces drumming along to these songs and trying to rationalize loving a pop-punk record this much in 2019.

      I spent a good chunk of time in 2018 trying to write a horror novel. Imposter syndrome and writer's block worked in concert together to prevent anything substantial from being produced and the story lives in my head to this day, taunting me. One useful culprit for keeping this story from disappearing entirely from my mind is Dance With the Dead's _Loved to Death_. It's campy horror sound hints at the feel I wanted to capture in my writing. Riding a line between techno/dance and power metal, this California-based duo really gave me something to feed off of in my creative moments, much in the same way _The Grid_ by Mega Drive did in the previous year. The tense and victorious rhthyms kept me focused, and the songs seem to demand a story all by themselves. Perhaps one day I'll get that story written.

      I would never have thought one of the most beautiful albums I'd listen to would have so much black metal in it. I loved _Sunbather_ when it came out in 2013 but never really had a moment to myself where the thought occured that "Hey, I like this band." I let _New Bermuda_ come and go without any attention, but for some reason found myself chained to _Ordinary Corrupt Human Love_ throughout the summer. I think it will always remind me of the long walks along the streets of Astoria, Queens that I took while listening to this album. It's hopeful and beautiful lyrics are hard to decipher through Clarke's static screams, but the heart of this record is found in every element of its makeup. This record, more than any of the others I listened to this year, feels like a piece of art.

      Starting with a choral echo backed bass thump that would feel more at home on a new blink-182 album, this record is Direct Hit!'s most dynamic and mature record yet. Frequently wrestling with themes of death and the meaning of life, this existentialism-as-concept-album shows a band reaching for something higher than another pop punk album with a hard candy shell. Revelling in their nihilist refutations of our traditional conceptions of heaven and hell, Direct Hit! asks us to enjoy what we can in this terrible world before we inevitably shuffle off this mortal coil, and that's cool with me.

      Through the thumping crecendos and and past the creative synths, this record is very pretty and very sad. I don't listen to a lot to EDM, but _'Til the End_ caught my attention for it's ability to constantly pull my attention back with its narrative. Woven between instrumentals, the break-up of a relationship unfolds via MitiS's guest singers while the tracks themselves dance around the subject at hand. The desperate bargaining of _By My Side_ describes that terror of impending heartbreak, while it is harshly rebutted in _For Miles & Miles_ telling the listener to "Don't think just walk away and forget me." _Embers_ ends the story with romanticized denial finally giving way to acceptance, and the record leaves us with a victorious few minutes to contemplate where we go now in _Dreams_.

      I am quite biased when it comes to **KG&TLW**, so finding them on any list of mine is basically a foregone conclusion. The band is so prolific that often the decision is not whether or not their latest record belongs in this year's list, it's which one belongs there. But the idea of these guys putting together a narrative-driven concept album based on fantastic stories of human-animal hybrids, lightning battles, and a universe murdered by vomit, I didn't even need to hear the record to know it was one of my favorites. The chaotic rhythms and breakneck tempos are to be expected from **King Gizz**, but what sets this record apart from their other albums is the spoken-word narrators, something they haven't done since _Eyes Like the Sky_

      When **Pedro the Lion** announced their breakup, I was pretty sad. I mean, I had always understood **PTL** to be David Bazan's musical vehicle and any other musician accompanying him was merely a temporary passenger, so it was confusing that it even _could_ breakup. I eventually understood that Bazan had simply tired of the moniker and wished to be honest about what this really was. Explaining his decision in his first solo release, Bazan sings "I still run the show / Don't you forget it / So I had to let some go / Don't think I don't regret it / Because I do and I don't / Think I'm better off alone" and makes it pretty clear. Bazan had shed his faith and was now shedding any pretense of even being in a band and this would allow him to go beyond what he had created **Pedro the Lion** for.

      Bazan's _Control_ is one of the most influential and powerful records I've ever listened to. The record's depiction of relationships and their entropic conclusions was a relatable subject during my teens as the child of bitterly divorced parents. Listening to an (at the time) Christian artist that was willing to talk about these kinds of subjects was therapeutic. I could relate to a lot of his frustrations of being a believer disillusioned with modern American Christianity and wondering what that meant (A subject further explored in his subsequent albums and career). The crunching mid-tempo droning rock is a departure for **Pedro the Lion** that allowed the instrumentation of his songs reflect a lot of the violence told in these songs. The brutal honesty of tragic vanity is hammered home in each track as the loose narrative of a failed businessman who destroys his marriage and family with his infidelity, a path that ultimately leads him to finally be killed by his wife during an argument. I was lucky enough to watch a reunited **Pedro** play the _Control_ album in its entirety live in 2012 and loved watching these songs performed after spending so many evenings listening to this record.

    text: |
      There are records that can encapsulate entire periods of your life if you allow them. Listening to them again transports you right back to that moment, and you feel everything all over again as if for the first time. This record came out right as I was experiencing my first break-up in high school. Listening to _Your Majesty_ puts me right back in that desperate first heart-break and I can see myself wandering the small town in Florida I grew up in searching for an identity that hurt less. Being reminded that "I always will be haunted by the ones I've loved" was exactly the record I needed at that time which, along with **Hot Rod Circuit's** _Sorry About Tomorrow_, allowed me to feel and preserve that experience in a way that I can nostalgically revisit with these songs.
